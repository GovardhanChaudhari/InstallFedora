# InstallFedora
This is the install script menu based GUI for installing popular programs for new installs of Fedora
Note: Tested with Fedora 28 Workstation

# Instructions:
Add executable permissions chmod +x ./installscriptfedora
After making executable. Navigate to folder that contains 'installscriptfedora' type: sudo ./installscriptfedora

Ideally after all script options complete, you should reboot the PC.
Note: The bash script may download outdated packages via wget. They were tested & valid at the time of writing.
Therefore ensure you update the extensions via https://extensions.gnome.org

A restart is usually required.
